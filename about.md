My name is Edouard, I am a software engineering student at the École de Technologie Supérieure de Montréal, working part-time at Element AI. I have a keen interest in both machine learning and cryptography, coupled with a general love of mathematics.

Most of my open-source work can be found on my GitHub page, so feel free to snoop around!
